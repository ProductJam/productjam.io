            <p>Building products is hard, and being part of a product focussed team requires an increasingly broad and deep set of skills to succeed.</p>
            <p>Come along to <strong>ProductJam!</strong> and chat with other like-minded Product professionals to discuss what works and what doesn't, hear lessons learned and discover what still needs to be understood in order to deliver successful products.</p>
            <p>Each month we tackle a different topic or problem that is common across product development.  To begin, someone will present the topic then we hand over to the room to hear other peoples experiences, questions and thoughts on the matter.</p>
            <p>So whether you're a product manager, product owner, developer, designer, UXer or in any other role involved in making products, come along!</p>

                <p class="card-text">To start the conversation, we're delighted to be joined by Robert Wright - Product Manager from Conduent - who will share his story of the challenges and successes he faced trying to effectively illustrate the voice of the employees using his software to make product decisions.</p>
