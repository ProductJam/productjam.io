                <h3 class="card-title">Finding a niche; from agency to tech product business</h3>
                <h5 class="card-title"><em>Wednesday 29th May 2019</em></h5>
                <p class="card-text">Weâ€™re pleased to welcome <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomquay/">Tom Quay</a> - CEO at <a href="https://www.discoverpassenger.com/">Passenger</a> and Founder/Director at <a href="https://wearebase.com/">Base</a> - to ProductJam! to discuss his journey from agency to product business with Passenger - an integrated transport data management system.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Consumer expectations are increasing all the time and apps are fast becoming the main touch point between companies and their customers. Transport is no different.</p>
                <p class="card-text">In the era of AI and autonomous vehicles companies like Uber and Lyft are leveraging data to provide the ultimate in convenient transport to customers. Shared mass transit operators must work out their place in this future fast, or face extinction.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Tom will talk about how he has navigated his team away from a guns-for-hire agency model, into a full time technology product business, Passenger. And all without the lure of external investment.</p>
                <p class="card-text">He will be open about the lessons learned as well as the challenges ahead, and share how a small team from Bournemouth are changing the face of urban public transport in the UK.</p>
